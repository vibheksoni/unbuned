# Platform Availability

Which features work on which provider platform. **This table is the single source of truth in this skill** - per-feature sections elsewhere point here instead of restating availability. When writing code for a third-party platform (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry) or Claude Platform on AWS, check this table first; a feature not supported there means use the first-party Claude API surface or a different approach.

Columns: **1P** = first-party Claude API, **P-AWS** = Claude Platform on AWS (Anthropic-operated, same-day parity), **Bedrock** = Amazon Bedrock, **Vertex** = Google Cloud Vertex AI, **Foundry** = Microsoft Foundry. Yes = GA, beta = beta, No = not supported, unconfirmed = not verified either way when this was written.

| Feature | 1P | P-AWS | Bedrock | Vertex | Foundry | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Messages, streaming, tool use | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Core API |
| PDF input | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Structured outputs / strict tool use | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Adaptive thinking / effort | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Extended thinking | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Prompt caching (5m, 1h) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Automatic prompt caching | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | The legacy Bedrock integration (Opus 4.6 and earlier) rejects top-level `cache_control` with a 400 - explicit breakpoints only there |
| Token counting | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Citations | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Search results content blocks | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| Fine-grained tool streaming | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Bedrock: `eager_input_streaming` on the newer serving stack only (Opus 4.7/4.8/5, Fable 5, Sonnet 4.6/5); older deployments (Opus 4.5/4.6, Sonnet 4.0/4.5, Haiku 4.5) 400 on the field |
| Compaction | beta | beta | beta | beta | beta | |
| Context editing | beta | beta | beta | beta | beta | |
| Context windows (1M) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| `inference_geo` (data residency) | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | |
| **Server-side tools** | | | | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Web search | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Vertex: basic `web_search_20250305` only (no `_20260209` dynamic filtering). Foundry Hosted on Azure: basic `web_search_20250305` only |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Web fetch | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Foundry Hosted on Azure: basic `web_fetch_20250910` only |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Code execution | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Foundry: Hosted on Anthropic deployments only - Hosted on Azure returns a 400 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Tool search | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Bedrock: InvokeModel API only, not Converse |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Advisor tool | beta | beta | No | No | No | |
| **Client-implemented tools** | | | | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Bash, text editor, memory | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Computer use | beta | beta | beta | beta | beta | `computer_20251124` and older versions: beta on all five platforms. {{OPUS_NAME}} accepts only `computer_toolset_20260801` (GA, no beta header) on the Claude API and Google Cloud, and still accepts `computer_20251124` on Amazon Bedrock (`shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{OPUS_NAME}}, breaking change 4). {{SONNET_NAME}} accepts only the toolset on the Claude API and Google Cloud, but still accepts `computer_20251124` on Amazon Bedrock, and rejects `computer_20250124` everywhere (`shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{SONNET_NAME}}, breaking change 4) |
| **Agentic / orchestration** | | | | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Agent Skills (Messages API) | Yes | Yes | No | No | beta | Foundry: Hosted on Anthropic deployments only - Hosted on Azure returns a 400 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Programmatic tool calling | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Foundry: Hosted on Anthropic deployments only - Hosted on Azure returns a 400 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;MCP connector | beta | beta | No | No | beta | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Managed Agents | beta | beta | No | No | No | Foundry: No (inferred; not in Foundry docs either way) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Self-hosted sandboxes | beta | beta | No | No | No | P-AWS: worker authenticates with IAM/SigV4 or an AWS-Console API key + `AnthropicSelfHostedEnvironmentAccess` (Console environment keys don't work there); sessions on self-hosted environments cannot attach memory stores; `GET /v1/environments/{id}/work` list endpoint not supported, other work endpoints OK |
| **API endpoints** | | | | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Message Batches | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Files API | Yes | Yes | No | No | beta | Foundry: Hosted on Anthropic deployments only - Hosted on Azure returns a 400 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Models API | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | |
| **Other** | | | | | | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-conversation system messages | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}}, {{OPUS_NAME}}, Claude Opus 4.8, {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}, {{FABLE_NAME}}, {{PREV_MYTHOS_NAME}}, {{MYTHOS_NAME}}, {{SONNET_NAME}}; not {{PREV_SONNET_NAME}}. Bedrock: InvokeModel passthrough, not ARN-versioned models |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Mid-conversation tool changes | beta | beta | beta | beta | No | Same models as mid-conversation system messages; beta `mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01` |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Turn-scoped (`clear_at`) system messages | beta | beta | beta | beta | No | Same models as mid-conversation system messages; beta `mid-conversation-system-clear-at-2026-08-21` (on Bedrock/Vertex pass the value as a beta) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Per-message `effort` (system message `output_config`) | beta | unconfirmed | unconfirmed | beta | unconfirmed | {{FABLE_NAME}}, {{MYTHOS_NAME}}, {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}}, {{OPUS_NAME}}, {{SONNET_NAME}} (thinking on only - a 400 with `between_tools`); beta `mid-conversation-output-config-2026-07-01`; on the Claude API and Google Cloud, open to any organization that sends the header (Claude Platform on AWS/Bedrock/Foundry unconfirmed; {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}} excluded on Bedrock) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;`thinking.display: "updates"` | beta | beta | beta | beta | beta | {{FABLE_NAME}}, {{MYTHOS_NAME}}, {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}, {{OPUS_NAME}}, {{SONNET_NAME}} (with adaptive thinking); beta `thinking-display-updates-2026-08-18` (pass the beta value per platform); without it `"updates"` is rejected as an unknown `display` value |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking block-binding controls | beta | beta | beta | beta | unconfirmed | `thinking.block_binding` + `input_transformations`; beta `thinking-binding-controls-2026-08-01` (the same beta name on the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, Bedrock, and Vertex - Bedrock: the `anthropic_beta` body field, Vertex: the `anthropic-beta` HTTP header); Foundry unconfirmed; wherever the header is rejected, use strip-and-retry; the history-editing enforcement itself follows the account-age rule in `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{FABLE_NAME}} from {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}} |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Server-side `fallbacks` | beta | beta | No | No | No | `"default"` -> beta `server-side-fallback-2026-07-01`; array form -> beta `server-side-fallback-2026-06-01` |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Fast mode | beta | No | No | No | No | Research preview, beta `fast-mode-2026-02-01`, first-party API only ({{PREV_OPUS_NAME}} / Opus 4.8 at $10 / $50; {{OPUS_NAME}} at $8 / $40) |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Cache diagnostics | beta | No | No | No | No | First-party API only |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;Task budgets | beta | beta | No | No | No | Beta header `task-budgets-2026-03-13`; 3P availability not documented - assume unsupported |

GROUNDING (reviewer-only; stripped at runtime by processSkillMarkdown).
Unless marked as a live page, paths below are under docker_eval/resources/cdp-skill/public-docs/.

Re-checked on 2026-09-19 against the live pages under
https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/ (the line refs further down point into the
older vendored snapshot):
- Foundry cells of PDF input, structured outputs, adaptive thinking/effort,
  extended thinking, token counting, citations, search results, 1M context,
  web search, web fetch, code execution, tool search, bash/text editor/memory
  and programmatic tool calling: build-with-claude/overview (Features overview
  tables; the rows it marks with a dagger are the hosting-option ones).
- Hosted on Azure limits (the "Hosted on Anthropic deployments only" notes and
  the basic web search/fetch versions): build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry,
  "Additional features not supported when hosted on Azure".
- Computer use row note: live page agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool,
  "Compatibility" (not part of the 2026-09-19 re-check), as cited by
  model-migration.md § Migrating to {{OPUS_NAME}}, breaking change 4.
- Mid-conversation tool changes row: build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages
  (same models as system messages; Claude API, Bedrock, Google Cloud). P-AWS is
  beta by parity: build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws, "Feature support"
  ("full feature parity with the first-party Claude API (except where noted in
  the feature limitations)"), whose limitations do not list tool changes.
