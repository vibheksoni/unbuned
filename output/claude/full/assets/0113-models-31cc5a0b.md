# Claude Model Catalog

**Only use exact model IDs listed in this file.** Never guess or construct model IDs - incorrect IDs will cause API errors. Use aliases wherever available. For the latest information, WebFetch the Models Overview URL in `shared/live-sources.md`, or query the Models API directly (see Programmatic Model Discovery below).

## Programmatic Model Discovery

For **live** capability data - context window, max output tokens, feature support (thinking, vision, effort, structured outputs, etc.) - query the Models API instead of relying on the cached tables below. Use this when the user asks "what's the context window for X", "does model X support vision/thinking/effort", "which models support feature Y", or wants to select a model by capability at runtime.

```python
m = client.models.retrieve("claude-opus-4-8")
m.id                 # "claude-opus-4-8"
m.display_name       # "Claude Opus 4.8"
m.max_input_tokens   # context window (int)
m.max_tokens         # max output tokens (int)

# capabilities is an untyped nested dict - bracket access, check ["supported"] at the leaf
caps = m.capabilities
caps["image_input"]["supported"]                       # vision
caps["thinking"]["types"]["adaptive"]["supported"]     # adaptive thinking
caps["effort"]["max"]["supported"]                     # effort: max (also low/medium/high)
caps["structured_outputs"]["supported"]
caps["context_management"]["compact_20260112"]["supported"]

# filter across all models - iterate the page object directly (auto-paginates); do NOT use .data
[m for m in client.models.list()
 if m.capabilities["thinking"]["types"]["adaptive"]["supported"]
 and m.max_input_tokens >= 200_000]
```

Top-level fields (`id`, `display_name`, `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`) are typed attributes. `capabilities` is a dict - use bracket access, not attribute access. The API returns the full capability tree for every model with `supported: true/false` at each leaf, so bracket chains are safe without `.get()` guards. TypeScript SDK: same method names, also auto-paginates on iteration.

### Model Descriptions
- **{{FABLE_NAME}}** - Anthropic's most capable widely released model, for the most demanding reasoning and long-horizon agentic work. Successor to {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}} in the same tier at the same per-token price ($10/$50 per MTok; cache reads $0.25/MTok - 0.025x, a quarter of {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}'s; batch $5/$25); stronger long-running agentic coding, knowledge work with documents/spreadsheets/slides, multistep research, vision, long-context retrieval, and computer use. Same API surface as {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}} (thinking always on, no prefill, no sampling params, `refusal` stop reason, 512-token cache minimum) with three breaking changes: forced tool use (`tool_choice` `any` / `tool`) returns a 400; thinking blocks are bound to the producing model (only {{MYTHOS_NAME}} can read them - other models drop them); and editing earlier turns invalidates thinking blocks ("preserved thinking"; new accounts created on/after 2026-08-31 get a 400 on edited history on every platform, and enforcement scope is decided per model; the opt-in controls beta is on the Claude API, Claude Platform on AWS, Bedrock, and Vertex - Foundry unconfirmed, `shared/platform-availability.md`). Adds per-message `effort`, turn-scoped `clear_at` system messages, `thinking.display: "updates"` progress updates, and content provenance. Same tokenizer as {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}; 1M context (default), 128K max output. Covered Model: 30-day retention required (ZDR only if expressly authorized by Anthropic) - ZDR orgs get `400 invalid_request_error`, as on {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}. No Priority Tier; shares the Fable 5.x rate-limit pool. See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{FABLE_NAME}} from {{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}.
- **{{PREV_FABLE_NAME}}** / **{{PREV_MYTHOS_NAME}}** (`{{PREV_FABLE_ID}}` / `{{PREV_MYTHOS_ID}}`) - the previous Fable / Mythos release: same tier, limits and per-token pricing as {{FABLE_NAME}}, which adds three breaking API changes over them (see above; cache reads here are $1/MTok rather than {{FABLE_NAME}}'s $0.25); still served and selectable by id. {{PREV_MYTHOS_NAME}} ran no safety classifiers, so `stop_reason: "refusal"` does not occur on it. Prefer {{FABLE_ID}} for new work.
- **{{MYTHOS_NAME}}** - The same model as {{FABLE_NAME}} (same capabilities, limits, per-token pricing, API behavior - except it does not run the history-editing check), offered only to approved Project Glasswing customers; successor to {{PREV_MYTHOS_NAME}} (which itself succeeded the invitation-only `claude-mythos-preview`). Unlike {{PREV_MYTHOS_NAME}} it runs safeguards that depend on the access program, so handle `stop_reason: "refusal"`. Not offered on Claude Platform on AWS. Use it only when the org participates in Project Glasswing; otherwise use `{{FABLE_ID}}`.
- **{{OPUS_NAME}}** - Successor to {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}} in the Opus line for long-running agentic coding and knowledge work, at a lower price ($4 / $20 per MTok; cache reads $0.20). Same 1M context, 128K output, tokenizer, and feature set as {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}}, with four breaking changes: thinking can't be disabled (effort is the only control, default `medium`), forced `tool_choice` 400s, thinking blocks are tied to the model and the conversation, and computer use needs the `computer_toolset_20260801` toolset. Broader safety classifiers (`bio` and `reasoning_extraction` join `cyber`). The current Opus and the default model; see `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{OPUS_NAME}}.
- **{{PREV_OPUS_NAME}}** - For complex agentic coding and enterprise work; a step-change over Claude Opus 4.8, strongest on deep reasoning, agentic and long-horizon work, and test-time compute scaling, at half the cost of {{FABLE_NAME}} ({{FABLE_NAME}} remains the highest-capability tier). Safety classifiers can return `stop_reason: "refusal"` - handle it before reading `content`. A drop-in upgrade at Opus 4.8's pricing ($5/$25 per MTok) with the same feature set. Thinking is on by default (omitting `thinking` runs adaptive; `{type: "adaptive"}` is equivalent), and `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` is available only at effort `high` or lower - pairing it with `xhigh`/`max` returns a 400. Raw thinking tokens are never returned. Full effort ladder through `max`; 512-token prompt-cache minimum (down from 1024 on Opus 4.8); fast mode on the Claude API only. Elevated cybersecurity safeguards. Separate rate-limit bucket from the combined Opus 4.x pool. 1M context window (default and maximum), 128K max output. See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{PREV_OPUS_NAME}}.
- **Claude Opus 4.8** - The most capable model in the Opus 4 series - highly autonomous, state-of-the-art on long-horizon agentic work, knowledge work, and memory; clearer, warmer writing. Same API surface as Opus 4.7 (adaptive thinking only; sampling parameters and `budget_tokens` removed). 1M context window at standard API pricing (no long-context premium). See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to Opus 4.8 - a 4.7 -> 4.8 move is a model-ID swap plus prompt re-tuning, no new breaking changes.
- **Claude Opus 4.7** - Previous-generation Opus. Highly autonomous; strong on long-horizon agentic work, knowledge work, vision, and memory. Adaptive thinking only; sampling parameters and `budget_tokens` removed. 1M context window. See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to Opus 4.7.
- **Claude Opus 4.6** - Older Opus. Supports adaptive thinking (recommended), 128K max output tokens (requires streaming for large outputs). 1M context window.
- **{{PREV_SONNET_NAME}}** - The previous Sonnet; near-Opus quality on coding and agentic work. Adaptive thinking on by default (omitting `thinking` runs adaptive); manual `budget_tokens` removed; non-default sampling parameters rejected. `effort` supports `low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`. New tokenizer (~30% more tokens for the same text vs Sonnet 4.6). High-resolution vision (2576px). 1M context window, 128K max output. See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{PREV_SONNET_NAME}}.
- **{{SONNET_NAME}}** - Successor to {{PREV_SONNET_NAME}} in the Sonnet line, at the same prices ($2 / $10 per MTok; cache reads $0.20). Same tokenizer as {{PREV_SONNET_NAME}}; 1M context, 128K max output. Adaptive thinking on by default; effort default `high`, with recalibrated levels. Five breaking changes: `thinking: {type: "disabled"}` returns a 400 (send `{type: "between_tools"}` at effort `high` or below to turn thinking off), forced `tool_choice` 400s, thinking blocks are tied to the model and the conversation, computer use on the Claude API and Google Cloud needs the `computer_toolset_20260801` toolset, and the advisor tool rejects Claude Opus 4.8, Claude Opus 4.7, and {{PREV_SONNET_NAME}} advisors. See `shared/model-migration.md` -> Migrating to {{SONNET_NAME}}.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** - Previous-generation Sonnet. Supports adaptive thinking (recommended). 1M context window. 128K max output tokens.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** - Fastest and most cost-effective model for simple tasks.
